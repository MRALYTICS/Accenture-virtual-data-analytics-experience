# Accenture-virtual-data-analytics-experience
I participated in the open access Accenture Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program with Forage. Where I worked as a data analyst to help an organization named “Social Buzz” to analyze their data and help them understand how they can leverage on their massive amount of data.

# PROJECT OVERVIEW
* Client name: Social Buzz 
* Client industry: Social media & content creation 
* Year established: 2010 
* Location of HQ: San Francisco 
* Number of employees: 250 
Client background: 
Social Buzz was founded by two former engineers from a large social media conglomerate, one 
from London and the other from San Francisco. They left in 2008 and both met in San 
Francisco to start their business. They started Social Buzz because they saw an opportunity to 
build on the foundation that their previous company started by creating a new platform where 
content took center stage. Social Buzz emphasizes content by keeping all users anonymous, 
only tracking user reactions on every piece of content. There are over 100 ways that users can 
react to content, spanning beyond the traditional reactions of likes, dislikes, and comments. 
This ensures that trending content, as opposed to individual users, is at the forefront of user 
feeds. 
Over the past 5 years, Social Buzz has reached over 500 million active users each month. 
They have scaled quicker than anticipated and need the help of an advisory firm to oversee 
their scaling process effectively. 
Due to their rapid growth and digital nature of their core product, the amount of data that they 
create, collect and must analyze is huge. Every day over 100,000 pieces of content, ranging 
from text, images, videos and GIFs are posted. All of this data is highly unstructured and 
requires extremely sophisticated and expensive technology to manage and maintain. Out of the 
250 people working at Social Buzz, 200 of them are technical staff working on maintaining this 
highly complex technology'

# OBJECTIVE
* An audit of their big data practices
* An analysis of their content categories that highlights the top 5 categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
Business problem: The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.

My Job Role: I am the data analyst assigned to carry out analysis on the clients sample data sets, generate insights, prepare visualizations and prepare a presentation to the client.

Tools used to carryout this project include:

Microsoft excel: This was used to clean the datasets and generate key insights into the datasets.
Microsoft Power BI: This used to carry out visualization on the insights from my analysis.
Microsoft Power Points: I used this tool to prepare slides for presentation purposes to the client.
During this experience I have learnt and applied my data analytics skills to:

Clean the client’s data and carry out data modeling in Microsoft SQL Server.
Analyze the client’s data to highlight their top 5 content categories with the largest aggregate popularity.
Prepare data visualizations on Microsoft Power BI and carry out storytelling with data.
Prepare a presentation to the client using Microsoft PowerPoints and sharing insights gotten from the data.

#Tasks carried out on Microsoft excel.

I wrote queries to carry out data cleaning in MS SQL Server, I also wrote to model the datasets by creating connections using SQL JOINS. Lastly I wrote queries to analyze and generate insights into the client’s data sets.

Analysis and Insights (Visualizations and Dashboard).

From a total of 16 different content categories, the top 5 contents include animals, science, healthy eating, technology, and food. With contents on animals topping the charts with a total score of about 75,000 points.

In terms of percentage share of popularity amongst the top 5 content categories, animals has a popularity percentage share of 21.36%, followed by science with a popularity percentage share of 20.28%, healthy eating and food are in 3rd and 5th place respectively, with each having a popularity percentage share of 19.76% and 19% respectively.

Looking at the total number of posts by category we can see that the top 5 content categories are in sequential order with respect to the previous two visuals. animals tops the chart with a total of 1,967 posts, followed by science which has a total of 1,864 posts. In last place is public speaking with a total post of 1,266.

Looking at the total number of posts by content type, photos have the highest posts with a total of 6,847 posts, followed by videos with a total of 6,499 posts, in third place is GIFs with a total of 6,313 posts, and lastly audio with a total of 5,894 posts.

January is the month having the highest number of posts with a total of 2,218 posts, this shows that people post a lot during this period. Other high. Though there is a huge drop in total posts in the month of February with a total of 1,980 posts. From this chart we can see that posts by month undulating (rises and falls).

Final Dashboard:


Recommendations:

Animals and science are two of the most popular content categories, this shows that people enjoy “real-life” and “factual” content the most. So I would recommend that you keep creating more contents relating to these two categories.
Food is a common theme with the top 5 categories with “Healthy Eating” ranking as one of the highest. This may give an indication to the audience within your user base. You could use this insight to create a campaign and work with healthy eating brands to boost user engagement.
With rise in technology it is no surprise to see contents related to technology right up with the top categories. It show users enjoy your technology contents. I would recommend collaborating with some of the world’s tech giants as this would definitely make user engagement skyrocket.
